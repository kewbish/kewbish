# Hey - I'm Emilie, though you probably know me as Kewbish. 
I'm a student software developer, excited to build, develop, and create. Currently, I'm a first-year in Science at the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca) and an intern at [Liquid Galaxy](https://liquidgalaxy.eu).

Find me on the web on [my website](https://kewbi.sh/) [(and blog too!)](https://kewbi.sh/blog/). Otherwise, reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilie-ma-kewbish/), or get in touch: [kewbish@gmail.com](mailto:kewbish@gmail.com).
