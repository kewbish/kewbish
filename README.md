# Hey - I'm Emilie, though on the web I'm Kewbish.

I'm a student software developer, interested in all things web. Currently, I'm a second-year in Computer Science at the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca). I recently interned at [Replit](https://repl.it) in their frontend infrastructure (product) team, working on the IDE experience.

I'm inspired by the Web's potential to cultivate connections and empower creation. The sheer surface area of the Web means it's a central part of our lives â€” I'd like to explore how we can make it better. This is a Herculean task, but I've dabbled in extending [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/) and applying NLP to create expressive [tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) before.

Find me on the web on [my website](https://kewbi.sh/) [(and blog too!)](https://kewbi.sh/blog/). Otherwise, reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilie-ma-kewbish/), or get in touch: [kewbish@gmail.com](mailto:kewbish@gmail.com).
