# Hi there! I'm Kewbish.
Also known as Emilie.   
I'm a student software developer, excited to build, develop, and create. Right now, I'm an intern at [Liquid Galaxy](https://liquidgalaxy.eu).

üíº I work with web development with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Bulma + Hugo; and CLI and misc. development with Python. Currently, I'm exploring Flask and Vue.

üèÜ You might know me for being a [Google Code-in 2019 Grand Prize Winner](https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/)
and a [Grant For The Web Hackathon Winner](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-grant-for-the-web-x-dev-hackathon-winners-1nl4).
