# Hey - I'm Emilie, though on the web I'm Kewbish.

I'm a software developer interested in all things distributed systems and HCI. I'm also a gap-year senior in Honours Computer Science at the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca). Recently, I've interned at [Stripe](https://stripe.com), saving thousands in AWS costs by automating database assignments; at [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) on the Queues team, adding dashboard debugging features; and at [Replit](https://repl.it) on the frontend infrastructure team, working on the IDE experience.

I'm inspired by the Web's potential to cultivate connections and empower creation. The sheer surface area of the Web means it's a central part of our lives â€” I'd like to explore how we can make it better. This is a Herculean task, but I've dabbled in extending [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/), applying NLP to create expressive [tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/), and exploring distributed systems theory before.

Currently, I'm building [NestedName](https://nested.name), a site to find unique, clean domains like ma.tt, sive.rs, or [emilie.ma](https://emilie.ma).

Find me on the web on [my website](https://kewbi.sh/) [(and blog too!)](https://kewbi.sh/blog/). Otherwise, reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilie-ma-kewbish/), or get in touch at [kewbish@gmail.com](mailto:kewbish@gmail.com).
